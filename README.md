## Project Summary  

This notebook investigates how **vp and density controls porosity, and how porosity and bulk-density controls permeability in ParanÃ¡-Basin basalts**, a key question for carbon-storage site screening.  
Starting from raw well-log and core data (135 samples), it

1. cleans outliers,  
2. benchmarks naÃ¯ve raw-polynomial regressions,  
3. introduces **Legendre orthogonalisation** to cure multicollinearity, and  
4. visualises the final cubic fit with confidence & prediction bands.

## 1 Â· Why this project matters  

Basaltic formations have emerged as **prime targets for mineral COâ‚‚ trapping** (e.g. CarbFix, Wallula).  
Accurate yet interpretable porosity-permeability models are essential for:

* **Reservoir screening** â€“ quick injectivity estimates before expensive core-flood experiments.  
* **Numerical simulation** â€“ permeability curves parameterise reactive-transport models that forecast COâ‚‚ plume migration.  
* **Research transparency** â€“ orthogonal bases keep geology front-and-centre, avoiding black-box ML when sample size is limited.

## 2 Â· Skills demonstrated  

* **Statistical rigour** â€“ HC1 robust errors, VIF diagnostics, Cookâ€™s-distance checks.  
* **Feature engineering** â€“ Legendre polynomials to stabilise high-degree fits
* **Visual communication** â€“ publication-style plots with dual uncertainty bands and source-coded markers.

## 3 Â· Key questions answered  

1. *Is a simple cubic enough to model permeability?* â€“ Yes; RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.28 without over-fitting.  
2. *Which variable truly drives permeability?* â€“ Orthogonal fit shows the porosity contrasts are significant; density is secondary.  
3. *How reliable is the model?* â€“ Residual diagnostics confirm acceptable normality, homoscedasticity, and no high-leverage outliers.  
4. *What does uncertainty look like?* â€“ 95 % confidence and prediction envelopes are provided for decision-making margins.
